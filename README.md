### nu84b2

some of the original commands added in nu84b1 have been deleted so I can
get just one command to compile and working.  stay tuned for what command
this will be.

#### nu84b1

is the iox commands integrated in and does not compile

#### nu84a

is the original branch with the nu-command code integrated in prior
to adding in the iox commands... This code compiles
